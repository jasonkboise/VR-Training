## VR Training and the Medical Field

Virtual reality (VR) is defined as the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. In recent years, the technology behind these artificial worlds has been advancing at a rapid pace to make them feel even more real and interactive. With said advancements, VR has gained many new practical applications, one of which is its use in training professionals. Most prominently, it is being used for training in the medical field. Especially with the coming of the recent COVID pandemic, virtual reality training has become a game-changer for the healthcare industry. So today, I would like to discuss the impact of virtual reality training in the medical field.

First, it is important to understand what virtual reality training is. According to Pixo VR, “Virtual reality training is the digital simulation of lifelike scenarios for training purposes” (Pixo VR). The idea is for trainees to enter a 360°, active learning environment, experiencing sights and sounds that dissolve the barrier between virtual and actual reality. Using the headset and controllers, trainees look, speak, and move about freely in a 3D virtual setting, interacting with simulated real-world tools, machinery, and other trainees and instructors. This type of experience has become the new prominent simulation method for medical education.

So what are the benefits of training healthcare workers with virtual reality? First, it makes accessing clinical experiences simple. For a usual VR system, the only two things required are a headset and a laptop. Both of these are commercially available, making them easy to set up and safe for use. Because of this ease of accessibility, learners can largely go to a VR system by themselves and participate in a simulation whenever they want. This also frees up space and faculty time, as the intuitive software in the headset makes it largely able to be navigated alone by the student, in a relatively small environment compared to a traditional simulation (IN TEXT CITATION NEEDED). Also because of the commercial availability, there is no need for a high budget set up in order to have a meaningful training experience. 

Another benefit of virtual reality is that it is repeatable. Because of this, students can safely make mistakes, learn from them, and practice repeatedly to improve their performance. This is the hallmark of a successful simulation, and it can be done for a very reduced cost with fewer resources. According to Jack Pottle,”the cost of fully immersive [traditional] medical simulation approximates that for one learner to lead one simulation scenario costs over £200” (IN TEXT CITATION NEEDED). This doesn’t even include the initial cost of setting it up, and cost per year to upkeep. This can all total hundreds of thousands of dollars every year, whereas a high-end VR set up costs approximately £3,000 for a laptop and headset.  The software costs vary, but it is frequently under one-tenth of the cost of physical simulations. There are also practically no added upkeep costs, so overall there are substantial setup and running cost savings to be made with virtual reality.

So that is great that it is a cost effective tool, and that it is good for easy to set up and repeatable simulation, but does it actually improve learning? According to a paper by the Nation Center for Biotechnology Information, they found that after collecting data from many other studies on the effectiveness of training with virtual reality, 95% of the studies have emphasized the improvement of the skills of trainees (IN TEXT CITATION NEEDED). They also reported that the studies they collected found that the students had, “a better understanding of the exterior and interior spatial relationship of the organs and development of the anatomical knowledge of students through the application of VR” (IN TEXT CITATION NEEDED). VR simulations have also been directly compared with traditional physical simulations. One study had 84 nurses randomized to either be trained with physical or virtual simulations and compared their results. They found that learning was the same in both, but the VR simulation had the advantage of being much cheaper. So it is evident that virtual reality is also an effective tool for actually improving the learning of students and is not just a simple cost-cutting solution.

Of course, virtual reality simulation isn’t perfect, and can come with a few drawbacks. Firstly, it is not the end-all and be-all solution for teaching and learning in the medical field. It is simply a tool that is integrated into existing curriculum, not a replacement. For instance, there is no need to have an immersive simulation for some procedures.
